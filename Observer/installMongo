to install mongoDB community, follow this link and follow the steps.

	https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

To install pymongo, run(requires pip3):

	sudo pip3 install pymongo

After installing pymongo, to confirm it is installed run:
	
	python3
	import pymongo

If no error occurs pymongo is installed correctly.

Running the mongoDB is run with the command "mongod".
If issues persist, follow steps on this page: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948789/mongodb-mongod-complains-that-there-is-no-data-db-folder

To set up on my system, I used:
    sudo mkdir -p /data/db

And because following the steps on there didn't work for me I used(bad on me):
    sudo chmod 0777 /data/db
    
After that when I ran "mongod" mongoDB would start and run and wait for connections as normal.
